A research platform investigating **fairness across languages** in AI-powered learning environments. Built with Streamlit and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for KU Leuven Master's thesis research.

**Key Features:**
- 🌍 6-language experimental conditions (en, de, nl, tr, sq, hi)
- 🤖 Consistent AI model across all conditions (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- 📊 Comprehensive analytics and interaction logging
- 🔒 GDPR-compliant pseudonymization
- 📈 Real-time UEQ benchmarking and knowledge assessment

## Study Design

This platform investigates **fairness across languages** in AI-powered learning environments. Participants are randomly assigned to one of **6 language conditions**:
- **English (en)** – Germanic, high-resource
- **German (de)** – Germanic, high-resource
- **Dutch (nl)** – Germanic, mid-resource
- **Turkish (tr)** – Turkic, mid-resource
- **Albanian (sq)** – Indo-European (Albanian branch), low-resource
- **Hindi (hi)** – Indo-European (Indo-Aryan), high-resource

The experimental manipulation is the **language of LLM responses** while course materials remain in English. All participants interact with the same GenAI tutor (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash) but receive explanations in their assigned language.

### Reproducibility Note
- **Model**: `gemini-2.5-flash` via Google GenAI SDK
- **Temperature**: 0.2 (low variance for consistency)
- **Top-p**: 0.95 (nucleus sampling)
- **Model provider & version**: Stored in `meta/experiment_meta.json` for each session
- **Content version**: Tracked in session metadata for longitudinal comparisons

## Directory structure

Each time a participant opens the app a new _session directory_ is created under **`output/`**:

```
output/
  ├── 20250427_120345_Alex_Smith/   # <timestamp>_<fake-name>
  │   ├── profile/                  # uploaded & parsed student profile
  │   ├── knowledge_test/           # quiz results
  │   ├── learning_logs/            # tutor‑chat logs
  │   ├── ueq/                      # UEQ answers + benchmark
  │   ├── analytics/                # interaction analytics & final research data
  │   │   ├── interaction_analytics.json
  │   │   └── final_research_analytics.json  # ★ Comprehensive research data
  │   └── meta/                     # page‑timer JSON, etc.
  └── research_analysis.json        # ★ Aggregate analysis across all sessions
```

### Pseudonymisation in a nutshell
1. When `SessionManager` starts it creates the session ID `(timestamp + fake name)` and writes it to `output/…/condition.txt`.
2. A **pseudonymised** copy of the profile replaces the real name with the fake name.  Down‑stream components read only this copy.
3. All later artefacts (chat logs, test results, UEQ) live in the same folder and therefore inherit the fake identifier.

## Key components
| file | role |
|------|------|
| `main.py` | navigation, page timer, session wiring, language routing |
| `Gemini_UI.py` | multilingual tutor UI & helpers (preview-only mode) |
| `session_manager.py` | directory & pseudonym handling, analytics consolidation |
| `learning_interaction_logger.py` | buffered file logger for tutor interactions |
| `testui_profilesurvey.py` | student‑profile questionnaire |
| `testui_knowledgetest.py` | 5‑item multiple‑choice quiz (Q5 partial credit) |
| `testui_ueqsurvey.py` | 26‑item UEQ short form + benchmark (reverse-coded) |
| `page_timer.py` | per‑page dwell‑time measurement (monotonic clock) |
| `constants.py` | single source of truth for platform constants |
| `authentication.py` | credential-based language assignment & dev mode |
| `presence_tracker.py` | concurrent session limiting via Supabase |
| `capacity_manager.py` | non-blocking wait UI for platform capacity |
| `supabase_storage.py` | cloud backup for session data (PII-safe) |

## Language Assignment

Language conditions are assigned via **authentication credentials** (not visible to participants).  
Each credential maps to one of the 6 language codes (en, de, nl, tr, sq, hi).

```python
# authentication.py – credential configuration
{"username": "pilot_en_01", "language_code": "en"}
{"username": "pilot_de_01", "language_code": "de"}
# ... etc for all 6 languages
```

The language is **locked at login** and stored in:
1. `st.session_state["language_code"]` – runtime state
2. `output/<session>/meta/experiment_meta.json` – permanent record

**No UI toggle exists** to prevent participants from changing language mid-session.

---
## Selecting the study condition *(personalised vs generic)*

Participants must **not** know which branch they get.  
The choice is therefore made in **code, not in the UI**.

```python
# main.py – near the top
DEFAULT_PERSONALISED: bool = True  # True → personalised, False → generic
```

1. Set the flag, save the file, restart the Streamlit server.
2. The flag is copied into `st.session_state["use_personalisation"]` and cached for the whole run.
3. `SessionManager` writes the chosen condition to `output/…/condition.txt` so it is visible during analysis.

*Tip:* when `DEV_MODE = True` you can still uncomment the old facilitator radio‑button to flip the condition interactively while testing.

## Research Analytics System

This platform includes a comprehensive analytics system that automatically consolidates all research data into a single JSON file per session. When participants complete the study (finish UEQ survey), a `final_research_analytics.json` file is generated containing:

- **Session info**: ID, condition, pseudonym, timestamps
- **Page timings**: Time spent on each phase of the study
- **Interaction data**: AI interactions, slide explanations, manual chat
- **UEQ results**: Survey responses, scale scores, benchmark grades
- **Knowledge test**: Answers, accuracy, performance metrics
- **Summary metrics**: Learning efficiency, engagement patterns

### Analytics & Deployment Tools

Operational scripts for Supabase deployment/verification and analytics sync are available in the `tools/` directory.
